Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.","prerequisites":["9.40","18.06"],"cp":[2550,1170],"offset":80,"display":"none"},"_owner":null,"_store":{}}],"filteredCrsList":[],"map":{"1":"6.042","3":"6.045","5":"6.0001","14":"6.006","17":"6.009","18":"6.031","23":"6.806","24":"6.046","27":"6.004","28":"6.033","33":"6.345","35":"6.036","36":"6.01","37":"6.003","38":"6.801","43":"6.834","44":"6.034","47":"6.872","52":"6.819","54":"6.803","55":"6.863","57":"6.802","58":"9.21","63":"6.438","64":"6.437","65":"6.860","67":"6.804","68":"9.49","71":"15.780","80":"14.13","81":"14.12","87":"9.19","88":"9.40","90":"14.01","91":"14.05","92":"14.32","94":"6.041","95":"6.207","97":"9.35","98":"9.01"}}
